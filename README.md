This is a very simple Readme file to remind myself of the tragedic past that I put my project folder inside Unity Hub folder by mistake
(Fuck unity hub idk why its been installed twice in my computer)
And Some days ago I saw a prompt in Unity Hub saying there's an availabe update for it and I just clicked the "update" button
And then boom, all my project files are deleted by this stupid update
And unfortunately I don't have any fucking backups for my project
So I need to totally Rework my project
Fuck me
Fuck it
Fuck Unity

Anyway, this time I am fucking CLEAVER, I backed up my project in github from the beginning of my rework
I AM NOT AFRAID OF YOUR UPDATE ANYMORE, UNITY HUB
