## Description

This is a very simple Readme file to remind myself of the tragedic past that I put my project folder inside Unity Hub folder by mistake.

(Fuck unity hub idk why its been installed twice in my computer)

And Some days ago I saw a prompt in Unity Hub saying there's an availabe update for it and I just clicked the "update" button.

And then boom, all my project files were deleted by this stupid update.

And unfortunately I didn't have any fucking backups for my project.

So I need to totally Rework my project.

Fuck me

Fuck it

Fuck Unity

Anyway, this time I am fucking CLEAVER, I backed up my project in github from the beginning of my rework.
# I AM NOT AFRAID OF YOUR UPDATE ANYMORE, UNITY HUB. I AM NOT. COME AND FIGHT MEEEEEEEE!
