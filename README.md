<p>This is a very simple Readme file to remind myself of the tragedic past that I put my project folder inside Unity Hub folder by mistake.</p>
<p>(Fuck unity hub idk why its been installed twice in my computer)</p>
<p>And Some days ago I saw a prompt in Unity Hub saying there's an availabe update for it and I just clicked the "update" button.</p>
<p>And then boom, all my project files were deleted by this stupid update.</p>
<p>And unfortunately I didn't have any fucking backups for my project.</p>
<p>So I need to totally Rework my project.</p>
<p>Fuck me</p>
<p>Fuck it</p>
<p>Fuck Unity</p>

<p>Anyway, this time I am fucking CLEAVER, I backed up my project in github from the beginning of my rework.</p>
<h1>I AM NOT AFRAID OF YOUR UPDATE ANYMORE, UNITY HUB. I AM NOT. COME AND FIGHT MEEEEEEEE!</h1>
